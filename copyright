   intends this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity

   of all rights includes the relinquishment of all rights to enforce
   (by lawsuit or otherwise) those copyrights in the Work.

   Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work
   may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified,
   built upon, or otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose,
